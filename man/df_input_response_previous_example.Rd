\description{
This sample data set is similar to `df_input_response_example` but includes two previous sets of evaluations. It serves as an example for generating plots or analyses that compare current responses with past evaluation dates, offering insights into the speaker's language development over time.

Each entry is a binary indicator (1 or 0), representing whether the speaker responded to a specific referent for each verbal operant.
