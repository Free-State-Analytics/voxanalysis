### `r speaker_full_name`'s VOX Analysis

*Evaluation date: `r as.Date(max(params$df_input_response$date_of_evaluation), origin = "1970-01-01")`*

The VOX analysis (*verbal operant experimental*) evaluates the language repertoire for `r speaker_full_name`, in order to provide an accurate autism spectrum disorder diagnosis.

A balanced repertoire implies that the speaker has a normal language development. An imbalance, measured and visualized below, implies the speaker has autism spectrum disorder.

### Clinician's Conclusions / Recommendations

***Please provide any supplemental information or conclusions here. Otherwise, you can delete this section***

### Responses

During a session, `r speaker_full_name` was supplied with several referants to interact with (i.e., toys and other objects). The listener engaged with `r speaker_full_name` to solicit a positive response to a verbal operant (conversing, listening, echoing, and repeating).

The table below shows the way `r speaker_full_name` responded:

```{r}
flextable(df_input_response)
```

### Area Q Plot

The Area Q plot helps visualize variance. A speaker with normal language development will have roughly equal points on each axis. A speaker with abnormal language development will have unequal points on each axis.

-   Centroid: **`r paste0("(",centroids$centroid[1],", ",centroids$centroid[2],")")`**

-   Centroidal distance: **`r centroids$distance`**

-   First moment of area Q: **`r centroids$moment`**


```{r}
#| fig-height: 3
#| fig-width: 3
#| fig-align: center
plot_area_q(
  df_summarized_response = df_summarized_response,
  v_primary_date = max(df_summarized_response$date_of_evaluation),
  doc_version_ind = TRUE)
```

### VOX Chart

The VOX Chart shows the responses based on the verbal episode. A speaker with normal language development will have relatively straight lines that overlap one another most of the time.

```{r}
#| fig-height: 2.5
#| fig-align: center
plot_vox_line(
  df_input_response = df_input_response,
  hide_heading = FALSE,
  doc_version_ind = TRUE)
```

### Cochran's Q

Cochran's Q is a statistical test is used to verify whether the speaker has a balanced repertoire. A p-value less than 0.05 means we reject the null in favor of the alternative that the speaker does have an imbalance.

```{r}
flextable(
  table_cochrans_q_test(
    df_input_response = df_input_response %>%
      filter(.data$date_of_evaluation == max(.data$date_of_evaluation))
    )
)
```

### SCoRE

The speaker has a SCoRE of **`r calc_speakers_SCoRE(df_summarized_response = df_summarized_response)`**.

*Stimulus Control Ratio Equation (SCoRE)* measures the proportionality of the speaker's repertoire on a scale of 0 to 1. A higher number indicates balanced language assessment.

The pie chart below further illustrates this balance or imbalance.

```{r}
#| fig-height: 2.5
#| fig-width: 2.5
#| fig-align: center
plot_vox_piechart(
  df_summarized_response = df_summarized_response %>%
    filter(.data$date_of_evaluation == max(.data$date_of_evaluation)),
  doc_version_ind = TRUE
)
```

### Prompt Hierarchy

```{r}
knitr::kable(
  table_prompt_hierarchy(
    df_summarized_response = df_summarized_response %>%
      filter(.data$date_of_evaluation == max(.data$date_of_evaluation))
  )
)
```
